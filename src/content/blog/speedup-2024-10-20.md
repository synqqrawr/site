## What?

Previously, I had like a 99/100 score on performance on Lighthouse which is really bad but, by doing some stuff I was able to bring it to 100, speeding up immensely.

### What?

First, I did some `_headers` magic to tell the browser that you could cache the whole page for 10 years if you want (except for the main document). This way, the site will feel much much more faster as you don't have to download that many stuff. Plus, because all the assets are cached, you won't have to worry about it never updating (although it did, and some people might've got that.)

Then, I unintalled shadcn-svelte as it's bundle size was enourmous. In fact, removing it made the bundle size half it's size!

I also made Sveltekit inline all it's styles, but it doesn't seem to give any visible performance improvements.
