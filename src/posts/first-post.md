## Introduction

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I made this site so I could do some blogging and some personal stuff â€” having a personal website is useful, isn't? ;)

## Why I created this

I created this site because I saw and read a bunch of Youtube videos, blogs, etc, where people are saying that giant, wall-gardened sites are ruining the internet and took away the charm of the old iternet. I've first used the internet in 2015 and first touched a computer at about 2013 (tbf, I only just touched my dad's computer) and even then I have vivid experiences of me playing Flash games and visiting various sites. While I can't say with my own experience that the internet was more vivid then (as even then I was only browsing big sites, duh) hearing the description of the old internet by a bunch people wanted me to experience that 'again', an experience that I never had the chance to experience.

## About the site

### How the site is going

The development of the site is going \*fine\* but it has some hiccups every so often so bare with me about that :\)

### Techy nerdy things about the site.

So, this site is created using Sveltekit, with Typescript for type-checking because why not, and as for CSS is using TailwindCSS because my friend got me to do so and is hosted via Cloudflare pages. I'm poor so I don't have custom domains and ATM I don't think I do need one.

~~Also, because I'm too lazy to write a hamburger menu mobile users would be stuck to going to the [HP](/) and clicking one of the pages there. sorry.~~ Not anymore :)

- E (2024-07-25 16:15 JP time): I added shadcn-svelte here, FYI.

### Evergreen?

I don't want information to be lost to time but, at the same time the information on this site probably won't be useful anyways so at the current momment git commit history should suffice. So yes, this blog will, at the current momment be evergreen but, I'll probably want to archive historical versions of the site so I'll deal with that later.

### Some goals from now on

I think I would like to make like a giant public bookmarks page where I'll just link various links that I find useful. A downside is that because with the current state of the interent, some websites might, oopsies, disappear or have their domains changed so I'll have to deal with that. (tbf, just pasting the IPs to the sites would solve the second issue but with that comes it's own issues so, yeah :\P)
