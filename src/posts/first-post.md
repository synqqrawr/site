## Introduction

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I made this site so I could do some blogging and some personal stuff â€” having a personal website is useful, isn't? ;)

## Why I created this

I created this site because I saw and read a bunch of Youtube videos, blogs, etc, where people are saying that giant, wall-gardened sites are ruining the internet and took away the charm of the old iternet. I've first used the internet in 2015 and first touched a computer at about 2013 (tbf, I only just touched my dad's computer) and even then I have vivid experiences of me playing Flash games and visiting various sites. While I can't say with my own experience that the internet was more vivid then (as even then I was only browsing big sites, duh) hearing the description of the old internet by a bunch people made me yearn to experience that 'again', an experience that I never had the chance to experience.

UPDATE: On second thought, actually the reason I made this reason is kinda cringe :P

## About the site

### How the site is going

The development of the site is going \*fine\* but it has some hiccups every so often so bare with me about that :\)

### Techy nerdy things about the site.

So, this site is created using Sveltekit, with Typescript for type-checking because why not, and as for CSS is using TailwindCSS because my friend got me to do so and is hosted via Cloudflare pages. Also, I'm using shadcn-svelte because why not? :\) I'm poor so I don't have custom domains and ATM I don't think I do need one.
